AuraDrop Privacy Policy

AuraDrop is a Chrome extension that adds playful context labels to publicly visible LinkedIn feed posts. 

Data Collection
- AuraDrop only reads text from publicly visible posts in your LinkedIn feed.
- No private messages, profile data, or personal identifiers are collected.
- No personally identifiable information (PII), health, financial, authentication, location, or browsing data is collected.

Data Usage
- Text is sent to a remote service to generate a context label and brief explanation.
- The remote service does not store or reuse your post text.
- Labels are cached locally in your browser for efficiency; the cache stores only a hash and the label, not the original post.

Permissions
- Storage: used for local caching only.
- Host permissions: used to read publicly visible LinkedIn posts and communicate with the backend service.

No Advertising, Tracking, or Sharing
- AuraDrop does not track your activity, show ads, or share data with third parties.
